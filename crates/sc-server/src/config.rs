//! Server configuration (technical design §16).
//!
//! [`ServerConfig`] is the small, plain settings value the CLI builds and hands
//! to [`serve`](crate::serve): where to bind, where the built `ui/admin` bundle
//! lives, session lifetime, and whether cookies carry the `Secure` attribute.
//! [`ServerConfig::from_args`] parses the handful of flags the `feldspar serve`
//! command accepts, so the binary needs no argument-parsing dependency.
